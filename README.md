# AnalogToDiscrete
This code generate 3 types of analog signals(Sine,Pulse,Triangular) -> Adding noise -> Sampling -> Reconstruct.
Also generate the Fast Fourier Transform of a sine signal.
**Note** : It is easy to make changes -for example the amplitude or the offset- so there is a variety of options.

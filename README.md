# AnalogToDiscrete
 <br />This code generate 3 types of analog signals(Sine,Pulse,Triangular) -> Adding noise -> Sampling -> Reconstruct.
 <br />Also generate the Fast Fourier Transform of a sine signal.
 <br />**Note** : It is easy to make changes -for example the amplitude or the offset- so there is a variety of signal options.
